          <h4>  "It's The Game of Life." was a game created by <strike>some of</strike> the greatest students at Google CSSI Chicago 2015. We created this game as a final project in our program that showcases a lot of the skills we learned in less than three weeks! We wanted to create a game that was creative, hilarious, and unpredictable. Here's more about the people who created the game:</h4>

            Hi everyone!! My name is Damerrick Perry. I just graduated from Innovations High School yesterday as the salutatorian of my class!! Additionally, I'd like to note that I was homecoming king and student council vice president my last year of school. Moving on, I'm so excited to attend the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign this Fall and I plan on majoring in physics and minoring in computer science (I plan on doing research on quantum computing)

            Other things about me:
            I was born and raised on the south side of Chicago my entire life.
            I love science, especially physics.
            I love seafood.
            I enjoy reading, going out to eat, and especially going to museums and art exhibits.
            My favorite TV shows include Big Bang Theory, The Office, and Family Guy.
            Oh, I have a twin brother!
            I'm excited to meet the other Google CSSI'ers this summer!

            Hi everybody, my name is Zach Gonzalez, and a lot of my friends call me Gonzo. I was born in Calabasas, California, moved to Nashville, TN when I was 9, and eventually moved to Chicago before my junior year when I was 16. I'm graduating from Latin School of Chicago this Thursday. This fall I will be attending Swarthmore College and playing on the baseball team there. I love sports, and I play baseball and basketball. I also love listening to music. I'll listen to anything good really, but my favorite genre is rap. I'm really looking forward to CSSI and to meeting all of you!﻿
